| "I'm phoning because I have no money for the train ticket." "No Money! Mother is always giving you money!" "This phone call is very expensive," Dianne said coldly. "Tell Mother please. I need the money." Jackie put the phone down. She took a cigarette from her bag and began to smoke. | "我打电话来事因为我没钱买火车票" "没钱!妈妈总是给你钱!" "这电话费很贵的" 戴安冷冷的说. "请告诉妈妈,我需要钱" 杰基放下电话,她从包里拿出香烟开始抽 |

He says...he says he's going to kill you!" Molly did not answer. She went out of the room and closed the door | "好吧,我并不想跟他谈话" 莫莉说到. 她打开门. "但是,妈妈,你不明白,他17岁了,这事他第一份工作.他非常非常生气,他说...他说他要杀了你!" 莫莉没有回答,她走出房间关上了门. |
| It was seven o'clock on Saturday evening. Jackie stood at the window. A car drove slowly up to the front door and stopped. A tall man with white hair got out. It was Albert, the bushand of Molly's sister | 星期六晚上7点.杰基站在窗口.一辆车缓慢的在前门停下来.一个高个子的白发男人走了出来,这是阿尔伯特,莫莉的姐夫 |
| "Here's Uncle Albert," Jackie said. "Always late." She went out of the room and opened the front door. Albert came in and went at once to Molly."Oh, dear. I'm very late. I Am sorry," Albert said. "Fifty years old today! What a wonderful dress!" | "这是阿尔伯特叔叔"杰基说到"总是迟到" 他走出房间打开前门. 阿尔伯特一进来就去找莫莉"噢,亲爱的.我来晚了,对不起," 阿尔伯特说 "今天50岁了!这裙子真漂亮!" |
| Molly did not smile. "Thank you, Albert. We're all getting older." Tonight she wore a long back dress, and the two black dogs sat at her feet. "Everyone is here now. Let's go in to dinner," she said. Everyone stood up and went to the table. | 莫莉没有笑."谢谢你,阿尔伯特,我们都更老了." 今晚她穿着一件黑色的长裙,两只黑狗坐在她的脚边. "大家现在都到了,我们开始晚餐吧" 她说. 所有人站起来来到桌子旁边 |

| He lived in Cambridge, in an expensive house. "Someone called Peter stoped me down the road," Albert said "Who is he? He's very angry with you, Molly." "That's Petter Hobbs, from the house across the road," Jackie said quickly. She looked across the table at Molly. "He lost his job last week and he's angry with everyone." | 他住在剑桥的一所很贵的房子. "有人叫皮特在路上拦下了我" 阿尔伯特说 "他是谁?他对你非常生气,莫莉." "那是皮特霍布斯,从路对面的房子来" 杰基很快回答说. 她看着桌子对面的莫莉 "他上周丢了工作,对所有人都很生气" |
| "It's Molly he doesn't like, " Albert said. Molly said nothing. Everyone began to eat. "How is Aunt Annie?" Jackie asked. "She's much worse now," Albert said. "She says in bed all the time. She needs a nurse twenty-four hours a day." "I am sorry," Molly said. Albert stopped eating and looked at Molly | "是他不喜欢莫莉" 阿尔伯特说. 莫莉什么都没说.大家都开始吃东西."安妮安逸怎么样?" 杰基问到 "她现在状况更差了" 阿尔伯特说 "她整天躺在床上,24小时需要护士照顾" "我很抱歉" 莫莉说.阿尔伯特停止吃东西并看向莫莉 |
| "It's very difficult and very expensive, you know. Annie feels very unhappy because you don't visit her, Molly. She loves you very much. You are her little sister, you know." Molly closed her eyes for a minute. "I know that, Albert. I am fifty years old, but I am always her 'little' sister" | "那样并不容易也很贵,你知道,安妮感到很不开心,因为你不去看望她,莫莉. 她非常爱你,你是她的小妹,你知道" 莫莉闭了一会眼睛. "我知道,阿尔伯特,我都50岁了,但是我一直是她的'小'妹妹" |
| "Well, we can talk about it later." Albert laughed. "Oh yes, we can talk later. It's always later with you, Molly. Always tomorrow. Never today." Jackie watched her mother. Her mother was angry with Albert | "好吧,我们晚点再说这个" 阿尔伯特笑到 "哦,是的,我们晚点再说.你总是晚点再说,莫莉.总是明天,从不是今天" 杰基看着她的妈妈,她的妈妈已经对阿尔伯特非常生气 |
| Molly never liked talking about her sister Annie and she did not like visting her because she was very ill. "That's a beautiful dress, Dianne. Is it new?" Jackie asked . "Thank you , Jackie. Yes it's new, and very expensive I got it on 'Wednesday,' " Dianne said. She smiled at Jackie. | 莫莉从不喜欢谈论她姐姐安妮还有为什么病了不去看望她的事情. "那是一件漂亮的裙子,戴安,新买的吗?" 杰基说到 "谢谢你,杰基.是新买的而且很贵.我周三才拿到" 戴安说,她超杰基笑着 |
| "All your things are expensive," Jackie said. She remembered the phone call on Thursday about the train ticket. "I don't like cheap things" Diane said. "And I'm going to need more money soon. I want to go to America. Can you help me, Roger?" "Oh no," Roger said. "Nobody wants to help you, Diane." | "你的所有东西都很贵" 杰基说到.她记得星期二的时候打电话关于火车票的事情."我不喜欢便宜的东西" 戴安说到 "还有我最近很需要钱, 我想去美国. 罗杰,你能帮我吗?" "噢不" 罗杰说到 "没人想要帮你,戴安" |
| "You don't like working, we all know that, but we all want you to get a job." Dianne laughed. "It doesn't matter, Roger. I don't need your help. Mother always helps me. Mother loves me best." She suddenly smiled, a quick, beautiful smile. But her eyes were cold. Jackie looked at her mother | "你不喜欢工作, 我们都知道这事.我们都希望你能去找份工作" 戴安笑起来."没事,罗杰,我不需要你的帮助. 妈妈总是会帮助我,妈妈最爱我了." 她突然笑了,一个快速又美丽的笑容,但是她眼睛里闪着冰冷.杰基看向自己的妈妈 |
| Molly's face was white. Jackie did not understand. Was here mother afraid of Diane? Jackie wanted her mother to be happy today. "Would you like some more meat, Uncle Albert?" Jackie asked. "Roger, can you give everyone some more to drink?" Roger got up and began to give more wine to everyone. | 莫莉的脸色发白.杰基不明白,难道妈妈害怕戴安?杰基希望她的妈妈今天能开心. "你还要些什么食物吗, 阿尔伯特叔叔?" 杰基说到 "罗杰,你能给大家倒些饮料吗?" 罗杰站起来开始给大家添一些红酒 |
| "This is good wine." he said. Molly smiled for the first time. "Yes, your father loved this wine. He often drank it." "Yes," Albert said, and looked at Molly. "Expensive, too." " Would you like to meet Mr Briggs this weekend, Roger?" Jackie asked quickly. | "这是好酒." 他说. 莫莉第一次笑了起来 "是的,你们的爸爸最喜欢这个酒,他经常喝" "是的," 阿尔伯特说到,并且看向莫莉. "还很贵. " "你愿意周末跟布吉斯先生见一面吗,罗杰?" 杰基很快的问到 |
| "He's the new man at the fram. He wants to meet you." "Briggs? Briggs?" Molly said, suddenly angry. "Don't talk to me about that man. I don't like him He wants half my garden for his farm. He needs more land, he says. I don't want him in my house. He's always dirty and he has bad teeth" | "他是农场信赖的,他想见你" "布吉斯?布吉斯?" 莫莉说,突然生气起来 "不要跟我说起这个人. 我不喜欢他,他想要我一半的花园.他说他需要更多的土地.我不想在我房子里见到他,他总是很脏还有一口烂牙" |
| Jackie stood up and got her bag. "Excuse me , I want a cigarette." "Cigarettes! Always a cigarette in your moth," Molly said. "I don't like it. Cigarettes aren't good for you." Jackie began to smoke. She felt angry but she said nothing. She wanted her mother to be happy this evening, But it was very difficult. | 杰基站起来走向她的包. "对不起,我想抽支烟" "抽烟! 嘴里总是叼着烟" 莫莉说到 "我不喜欢它,烟草对你不好" 杰基开始抽烟. 她感觉生气但是什么都没说.她想要妈妈今晚感到开心,但是非常困难 |
| Roger drank some more wine. "Well, mother, perhaps Mr Briggs is right. The garden is very big, you know, " he said. "It's a lot of work for you. The house is big, too. You're fifty now. You need to be more careful." "Roger! I don't need a nurse. you know! I work in the garden every day; I feel happy there." | 罗杰喝了些酒. "好吧,妈妈,也许布吉斯先生是对的.这个花园很大,你知道" 他说 "这对你来说是很繁重的工作.房子也大,你现在50岁了,你需要更小心一些" "罗杰! 我不需要护士,你知道!我在花园里每天都工作,在那里我感觉开心" |
| Molly stood up. "I know you all want my money. You come here for a free dinner, you don't want to see me. You don't love me. You want my house, and my money. Well, you can all wait. Nobody is getting more money from me, not before I die!" | 莫莉站了起来 "我知道你们都是想要我的钱.你们到这里来免费吃晚饭,你们并不是想要见我,你们不爱我.你们想要我的房子喝钱.好吧,你们都等着.在我死之前,你们谁也得不到我的钱!" |
| "Don't say that Mother!" Jackie cried. Molly walked across the room to the door. "I fell ill now. I'm going upstairs to bed." Molly left the room . Nobody moved. | 杰基哭着说到. 莫莉走到房间对面的门口 "我感觉病了,我去楼上睡觉了" 莫莉离开了房间,其他人都没有动 |
| "One day I'm going to kill that woman," Diane said quietly. Roger looked at Dianne but said nothing. Albert moved his head slowly up and down. | "总有一天我要杀了这个女人" 戴安小声的说. 罗杰看着戴安但是什么也没说. 阿尔伯特缓慢的把头抬起来有低下去 |
| "Ill? She's angry, that's all," he said. "Molly always gets angry about money. Why can't she be good to her sister? Annie's going to die soon. Molly knows that." Jackie finished her cigarette and stood up. "Would everyone like some coffee? Come into the kitchen and let's drink it there" | "病了? 她生气了,就是那样" 他说."莫莉总是对钱的事情感到生气.她为什么不能对自己姐姐好一点? 安妮已经快要死了.莫莉知道的" 杰基抽完她的香烟站起来 "大家想要喝些咖啡吗?到厨房里来喝点吧" |
| Earyly next morning the house was quiet. Suddenly there was a cry from the room next to Roger's, his mother's room. Roger opened his eyes and looked at the clock. It was nearly seven o'clock. He got out of bed and opened the door quietly. | 第二天早上房子里很安静.突然有人在罗杰旁边的房子哭出声来,他妈妈的房间. 罗杰睁开眼看向时钟,已经快七点了.他起床然后小声的打开房门. |
| At the same time the door of his mother's room opened and Diane came out. Her face was very white. "Roger! It's Mother! I brought a cup of coffee for her and I found her dead. She's dead ... dead in her bed," she cried. Roger went quickly to the door of his mother's room and looked in. | 同时,他妈妈的房门开了,戴安从里面出来.她的脸惨白. "罗杰,是妈妈! 我给她送来一杯咖啡,发现她死了,死在自己的床上,"她哭着说. 罗杰快步来到妈妈的房间查看 |
| The window was open but the room was warm. Molly was on the bed, one hand under her head. Roger went across to the bed and put his hand on her arm. It was cold. On he little table next to the bed was a hot cup of coffee and empty cup. "I'm going to call the doctor," Dianne said | 窗户是打开的但是房间里很温暖. 莫莉在床上,一只手放在她头上.罗杰来到对面的床边把手放在她的手臂上试探. 已经凉了. 在床边的小桌子上放着一杯热咖啡喝一个空杯子."我去找医生" 戴安说 |
| "She's dead" Roger said slowly. His face , too, was white. "mother is dead!" Diane walked across the room to the door. "I'm going to phone the doctor,"" she said again. "Wait a minute!" Roger called "let's tell the family first!" | "她死了" 罗杰慢慢的说,他的脸一样惨白 "妈妈死了!" 戴安穿过房间走到门口 "我去给一生的啊电话" 她又说了一遍. "等等!"罗杰说到 "我们先告诉家人们!" |
| "Family! Nobody loved Mother!" Dianne went out and ran downstairs. Roger slowly went downstairs after her and stood by the telephone. "Dr Pratt, this is Dianne Clarkson. It's my mother - she's dead. Can you come quickly?" Dianne put the phone down. | "家人! 没有人爱妈妈!" 戴安出去跑下楼,罗杰慢慢的跟着下楼和她站在电话旁边 "普拉特医生, 这是克拉克森戴安. 是我妈妈-她死了,你能快些来吗?" 戴安放下电话 |
| "it isn't true, Roger! Mother dead! Daddy died last winter, and now Mother." Dianne began to cry. "Don't cry, Dianne," Roger said. "Let's go upstairs and tell Uncle Albert and Jackie." "No! You tell them! Nobody loved Mother. You aren't sorry. Look at you! You want her money, That's all!" | "这不是真的,罗杰! 妈妈死了! 爸爸去年冬天死的,现在是妈妈." 戴安开始哭 "不要哭,戴安" 罗杰说 "我们上楼把消息告诉阿尔伯特叔叔喝杰基" "不!你去说,没有人爱国妈妈,你都不伤心,看看你!你想要妈妈的钱而已!" |
| Roger suddenly wanted to hit Dianne. "Be quiet!" he said. "What about you? You didn't love mother. You wanted her money, too. Don't forget that!" "It's true, " Dianne said. "Oh, I can't stay in this house. I'm going out. I'm going to the river with the dogs." "No, "Roger said. "The doctor's coming and I want you here!" | 罗杰忽然想揍安娜 "安静!"他说 "那你又怎样?你不爱妈妈,你也只想她的钱,别忘记了!" "是的" 戴安说 "噢, 我在这房子呆不下去了,我出去,我跟狗一起去河边" "不" 罗杰说 "医生马上就要来了,我要你在这里!" |
| Diane said nothing. She went into the kitchen and at once the dogs got up and came to her. "Beautiful dogs! Dady loved you and Mother loved you. Now I'm going to love you." She opend the back door and went out with the dogs. Roger did not move. He stood by the telephone. | 戴安什么都没说.她来到厨房,狗子门直接迎向她 "漂亮的狗狗! 爸爸爱你们,妈妈爱你们,现在我来爱你们" 她打开后门跟狗子们走了出去. 罗杰没有动,还是站在电话旁边. |
| "It's true" he thought "I am happy about the money. I needed money, and now I'm rich. Things are going to be easier for me now. But mother... why didn't I love her more? And now she's dead." Slowly, Roger went back upstairs. He wanted to dress before Dr Pratt arrived. | "是事实" 他想 "我喜欢钱,我曾经需要钱,但是现在我富裕了.事情我都能轻松硬度.但是妈妈...为什么我没有更爱她?现在她死了" 慢慢的,罗杰回到楼上,他想要在医生来到前穿戴整齐 |
| Dr Pratt was a little fat man without much hair. He was the family doctor and he knew all the Clarkson family very well. He went upstairs at once and looked at Molly's body. He looked carefully at the cup of coffee and the empty cup on the table next to her bed. | 普拉特医生是一个小个子的胖子,头发稀少. 他是个家庭医生,对克拉克森家的情况很了解. 他直接上楼来查看莫莉的身体. 他小心的看着她床边的那杯咖啡和空杯子 |
| "I'm sorry, Roger," he said. "Where is Dianne? She phoned me" "She went out wither the dogs" Roger said "She was angry with me - angry with everyone" Dr Pratt said nothing for a minute. "This is going to be very difficult. I'm going to phone the police, Roger" | "我很遗憾,罗杰" 他说 "戴安在哪里?她给我打的电话" "她跟狗子出去了" 罗杰说"她生我的气-她对所有人都很生气" 普拉特医生沉默了一会 "这是个艰难时刻. 我去给警察打电话,罗杰" |
| "Police! Why? What's wrong?" "I don't know. Your mother wasn't ill. I sal her on Thursday and she was very well. Why did she die? I don't understand. I want to find out." | "警察!为什么?有什么问题吗?" "我现在还不知道.你的妈妈没有病,我星期四看她还好好的,为什么她会死?我不明白.我想查明原因" |
| Roger went across to the window and looked out at the garden. It was beautiful summer morning. The sky was blue and the garden was green . It was all very quiet. His mother loved this garden. But Tom Briggs wanted the garden. And Roger wanted the garden, too. Roger felt worse and worse. | 罗杰来到对面的窗户看向外面的花园. 这事个漂亮的夏日清晨. 天空很蓝花园很绿.一切都很安静.他的妈妈喜爱这个花园.但是汤姆布吉斯想要这个花园,罗杰也想要这个花园. 罗杰感觉越来越差 |
| "Your mother took sleeping tablets," Dr Pratt said. "Did you know? On Thursday she had a new bottle of table, but I can't find it here in her room" "I didn't know, " Roger said. "Very well. Let's go downstairs and you can phone the police." Roger went into the kitchen and made some coffee. | "你妈妈吃了安眠药" 普拉特医生说 "你知道吗?星期四的时候她开了一瓶新药, 但是我没在她房间里见到" "我不知道" 罗杰回答到. "非常好,我们下楼去,你可以打电话给警察" 罗杰来到厨房煮了些咖啡 |
| Just then Dianne came in with the dogs. "Roger, " she said. "Look I'm sorry. I was angry and said some angry things" "It dosen't matter," Roger said "Here you are, have some coffee. Dr Pratt is phoning the police. Did you know Mother took sleeping tablets?" | 这时候戴安跟狗子们进来了 "罗杰" 她说 "我很抱歉,之前很生气对你说了气话" "不要紧" 罗杰说 "来,喝些咖啡. 普拉特医生正在给警察打电话. 你知道妈妈的安眠药瓶在哪里吗?" |
| "Well, the bottle is not in her room." "What? I don't understand." Dianne took the coffee and began to drink. Her eyes looked big and dark. Just then Dr Pratt came into the kitchen. "They're coming at once" he said | "好吧,那瓶药不在她房间里" "什么?我不明白" 戴安拿起咖啡开始喝. 她的严谨给看起来又黑又大.这时候普拉特医生进到厨房 "它们会直接过来" 他说 |
| "Diane - I'm sorry about your mother. " "Dr pratt, I want to tell you about last night. Everyone was very angry..." "Be quiet!" Roger said quickly. "Dianne never thinks before she open her mouth," he thought angrily. Dianne did not look at Roger. "Last night Mother went to bed early because everyone..." | "戴安, 对你妈妈的事我非常遗憾" "普拉特医生,我想告诉你做完的事情,所有人都很生气..." "闭嘴!" 罗杰很快说到 "戴安开罪之前从不动脑子" 他生气的叫嚷. 戴安没有看罗杰 "前一晚妈妈很早就上床了,因为所有人..." |
| "Don't tell me," Dr Pratt said. "You can tell the police." Roger's face went red. Suddenly he felt afraid. "The police are going to talk to everyone, and ask quiestions," he thought. "And they're going to want answers. It's going to be very difficult." | "不要跟我说" 普拉特医生说到 "你可以告诉警察" 罗杰的脸变得通红. 突然他感到害怕 "警察来了之后会跟所有人谈话病提问" 他想 "并且他们会寻找答案.这让事情变得很难办" |
| He finished his coffee and stood up. "I'm going upstairs" he said. "I'm going to tell Uncle Albert and jackie about Mother...and about the police." | 他喝完咖啡站起来 "我上楼去"他说 "我去告诉阿尔伯特叔叔和杰基关于妈妈..还有警察的事" |
| The police arrived very quickly. There were a lot of them. Some of them with cameras went upstairs to Molly's room. Two detectives talked to Dr Pratt in the kitchen . The family waited in the sitting room. It was a hot day again and the windows were open | 警察很快就到达了.他们来了很多人,一些人拿着相机进了莫莉的房间.两个侦探在厨房里与普拉特医生交谈.家人都在客厅里等待.天气很热,窗户都开着 |
| The dogs sat quietly at Dianne's feet. Nobody talked. Jackie smoked. They waited for a long time. Suddenly the door opened and the two detectives came in "Good morning. I am Detective Inspector Walsh and this is Sergeant Foster." The Inspector did not smile. He was a big man in an old black suit and black hat and coat | 狗子们安静的坐在戴安的脚边.没有人说话.杰基抽着烟.他们等待了很长时间.突然们开了进来两个侦探 "早上好, 我是沃尔什探长,这是福斯特探员" 探长没有笑,他是个大个子,穿着黑色的套装,戴着黑色的帽子和外套 |
| He wore a coat because he always felt cold. "Last night someone put sleeping tablets in Mrs Clarkson's hot milk. We are going to question everybody, and we need a room ,please" Roger stoop up. "I'm Roger Clarkson. You can have my father's old office. Come with me, it's along here." | 他穿着外套因为他总是感觉很冷 "做完有人在克拉克森夫人的热牛奶里放了安眠药. 我们有些问题要问所有人,我们需要一个房间,请安排下" 罗杰战旗来 "我是罗杰 克拉克森,你们可以用我父亲的旧办公室.跟我来,沿着这边" |
| The office was not a very big room, but there was a table and three or four chairs. Roger opened the window. "I would like to talk first to your uncle, Albert King," Inspector Walsh said. He took off his hat and coat and sat down behind the table. "Ofcourse," said Roger and left the room | 这间办公室不是很大,但是有办公桌和三四把椅子.罗杰打开窗户."我想先跟你的叔叔,阿尔伯特 金谈话" 沃尔什探长说.他脱下了外套和帽子,坐在了办公桌后面."当然可以"说完罗杰离开了房间 |
| Sergeant Foster waited by the door. He was a very tall young man with black hair and a nice smile. He was not very happy this morning because he usually played tennis on Sunday mornings.

| Albert looked at Inspector Walsh for the first time. "Yes, I was. Everyone was angry. Roger was angry. Dianne wanted money to go to America. Then there's a man called Tom Briggs... He wants half the garden for his fram. Molly was a rich woman. I need money because my wife Annie - Molly's sister - is very ill" | 阿尔伯第一次看着沃尔什探长 "是的,所有人都生气. 罗杰生气, 戴安想要钱去美国.一个叫汤姆布吉斯的...他想要一半的花园给自己的农场.莫莉是一个富有的女人. 我需要钱是因为我的妻子安妮-莫莉的姐姐-她病的很厉害" |
| "I told Molly this." "What appened next?" "Well, Molly was angry with everyone and went upstairs. We went into the kitchen for coffee. Jackie wanted everyone to go up and say good night to Molly. She lives here with Molly so she wanted Molly to be happy. At first Roger said no. He was angry and didn't want to see his mother." | "我告诉莫莉这些" "接下来发生了什么?" "好吧,莫莉对所有人发脾气然后上楼. 我们来到厨房喝咖啡.杰基想要所有人上去跟莫莉说晚安.她跟莫莉住在一起,她想要莫莉开心起来.一开始罗杰说不,他很生气不想见自己的母亲" |
| "And did you see Molly in her room?" "Yes, I was tired and I went upstairs first. I went to Molly's room and asked her for money again. But no - there was no money for her sister." Albert stopped and put his hand over his eyes. Inspector Walsh watched Albert for minute. | "那么你去莫莉的房间跟她见面了吗" "是的,我累了,先上楼. 我去了莫莉的房间,再次向她要钱. 但是不-她没有给她姐姐钱" 阿尔伯特停了下来并把手遮住了眼睛. 探长沃尔什观察了阿尔伯特一会. |
| "Did you hear noises after you went to bed?" "Everyone went into Molly's room to say good night, I think. Later, I heard someone... He- or she - went downstairs. That was about midnight." "Very well ,Mr King. Thank you , you can go now." Albert left the room. Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head. | "你在床上之后听到什么了吗?" "我想是所有人进道莫莉的房间道晚安. 晚一点,我听到有人..他或者她下楼,那时候大概是午夜" "非常好,金先生.谢谢你,你可以走了." 阿尔伯特离开了房间,探长沃尔什把手放在了自己头后面. |
| "What time is it ? I'm hungry. We're learning a lot, but I need some coffee." "Shall I go to the kitchen?" Sergeant Foster asked. "Oh, no. Later. Let's see Jackie Clarkson next." Jackie came in and sat down. She looked down at her hands and said nothing. | "现在几天了?我饿了.我们已经获取很多,但是我现在需要咖啡" "我能去厨房吗?" 探员福斯特问到 "噢,不. 晚点,让我们下一个见见杰基克拉克森" 杰基进来坐下,她看着自己的手沉默着 |

"Tell me , did your mother get her tablets from the shop in the village?" | "我们在戴安的房间里发现了你妈妈空的安眠药瓶" 探长突然说完,然后等着. 杰基的脸色没有任何变化也不作声. "告诉我,是你妈妈从镇上的商店里带回来那瓶药的吗?" |
| "Yes. My mother usually took a sleeping tablet every night so she needed a lot of tablets. Somtimes she got them from the shop, sometimes I did. On Thursday, I asked Peter Hobbs to get them .He lives in the house across the road, and he often goes to the village on his bicycle." | "是的,我妈妈通常每晚需要吃安眠药所以她需要很多药. 有时候她自己从商店取回来,有时候是我.星期四的时候,我请皮特霍伯斯取回来的.他住在街对面的房子,他经常骑着自行车去镇上." |
| "I see. Your mother wanted to stay in this house. How about you? did you want to move?" Jackie looked up for aminute and then down at ther hands again. "This is Mother's house. I loved my mother. She was good to me." "Did you see your mother in her room last night?" | "我明白. 你妈妈希望住在这个房子,你呢?你有没有想过搬走?" 杰基向上看了一会又看会自己的手. "这是妈妈的房子,我爱我的妈妈,她对我很好" "你做完有去见过你妈妈吗?" |
| "Yes, everyone did. Diane made hot milk and took it to Mother. She usually drank a cup of hot milk before she slept." inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head. Jackie was very quiet. "What did your mother say?" | "是的,所有人都去了.戴安做了一杯热牛奶给妈妈.她通常在睡之前喝一杯热牛奶." 探长沃尔什把手放在自己头后面. 杰基很安静 "你的妈妈说了什么?" |
| Jackie opened her bag and looked for a cigarette. "Can I smoke?" "Of course. This is your house," Inspector Walsh said. He watched Jackie. "What did your mother say?" he asked again. "She wanted to go downstairs angain. She remembered the dogs - she wanted to get some dinner for them" | 杰基打开她的包寻找香烟."我能抽烟吗?" "当然,这事你的房子" 探长沃尔什说到. 他盯着杰基. "你妈妈说了什么吗?" 他再次询问 "她想要再次下楼去,她想起了狗子们-她想去给它们做点晚餐" |
| "I went to my room and she went downstairs." "What time was this?" "I don't remember. About midnight, I think." "And the cup of hot milk?" "It was on the table by her bed." "Did you need your mother's money?" "No, Inspector. Money is not important to me. There are more important things," Jackie said quietly | "我回自己的房间,她下楼去了" "那时候大概什么时间" "我不记得了,可能是午夜,我想" "热牛奶呢?" "就在她的床旁边的桌子上" "你需要你妈妈的钱吗?" "不,探长,前对我不重要,有更多比钱更重要的事情" 杰基小声的说 |
| "Well, your uncle Albert wanted money. Tom Briggs wanted the garden. You wanted nothing?" Jackie finished her cigarette and looked up at the Inspctor. Her eyes were suddenly angry. "Don't forget Peter Hobbs. He lost his job because of my mother. He wanted to kill her, you know." | "好吧,你的叔叔阿尔伯特想要钱.汤姆布吉斯想要花园.你什么都不想要?" 杰基抽完烟抬头看着探长.她的眼睛里突然充满愤怒 "别忘记了皮特霍伯斯,他因为我妈妈丢掉了工作,他想要杀了她,你知道" |
| "And what about Dianne? You found the empty bottle in her bag." Inspector Walsh listened carefully. "We're going to question everyone, Miss Clarkson." Jackie said nothing for a minute. "Would you like some sanwiches and coffee, Inspector?" "Ah! Yes, please!" Inspector Walsh said warmly. | "那戴安呢?你们在她包里发现了空瓶子" 探长沃尔什注意的听着. "我们在询问每一个人,克拉克森女士." 杰基沉默了一会 "你们想要来点三明治和咖啡吗?" "啊!是的,谢谢!" 探长沃尔什热情的说 |
| "I would like sandwiches and coffee very much." Jackie left the room. Inspector Walsh thought about her. "Why was she suddenly angry?" The room was quiet. | "我非常想要三明治和咖啡" 杰基离开了房间. 探长沃尔什捉摸着她 "为什么她会突然愤怒?" 房间里安静下来 |
| After the coffee and sandwiches, Inspector Walsh called Roger Clarkson to the office. Roger came in and sat down. The Inspector began at once. "Now, Mr Clarkson. Why was your mother angry with you last night?" | 用完咖啡和三明治,探长沃尔什叫来罗杰克拉克森来道办公室. 罗杰进来坐下. 探长直接开始问 "现在,克拉克森先生,做完你的母亲为什么会对你很生气?" |
| "This house is very big," Roger said "It was a lot of work for Mother. I wanted her to move. But no, she loved this house and garden. She didn't want to move." "Tell me about your job, Mr Clarkson. Your mother is dead and now you're rich. Do you need money?" Roger's face was suddenly afraid. | "这个房间太大"罗杰说"妈妈总是需要做很多工作.我希望她搬走,但是不,她爱她的房子和花园,她不愿意搬家" "说说你的工作,克拉克森先生.你的妈妈死了,现在你很富裕.你需要钱吗?" 罗杰的脸上透露出恐惧 |
| "What are you saying? I didn't kill my mother. I need money ,that's true. A friend and I want to build ten houses here, in this garden. We can get a lot of money for them . So I wanted Mother to sell this house. It's true. But Mr Briggs wanted half the garde, too, you know, for his farm." Inspector Walsh moved a pencil on the table | "你在说什么?我没有杀我的妈妈.我需要钱是真的.一个朋友和我希望在这花园里建十间房子.我们可以赚很多钱.所以我希望妈妈卖掉这间房子,这是事实.但是布吉斯先生也想药花园的一半,你知道的,为了他的农场." 探长沃尔什从桌子上拿起一支铅笔 |
| "Tell me, what happened upstairs? You went to your mother's room?" "Yes, I did. I wanted to say goddnight to my mother." "Did you talk about the house again?" "Yes, I did. Again, she said no. She loved the house and didn't want to sell it." Inspector Walsh watched Roger for minute. | "告诉我,在楼上发生了什么? 你去了你妈妈的房间吗?" "是的,我去了, 我去跟她道晚安" "你再次谈论了房子的事情吗?" "是的,再次谈论了. 她说不,她爱这房子并且不想卖掉它" 探长沃尔什盯了罗杰一会儿 |
| "I see. We found the empty bottle of sleeping tablets, Mr Clarkson, in Diane's room." Roger's face did not change. "Oh? Someone put them there. Diane did not kil my mother, I know that. She found the body." "Very well. I would like to see Diane next." | "我知道, 我们找到装安眠药的空瓶子,克拉克森先生,就在戴安的房间" 罗杰脸色很正常 "噢? 有人放在那里的,戴安不会杀掉妈妈,我知道.是她发现的尸体" "很好,我想下一个见一见戴安" |
| Roger got up and left the room. Inspector Walsh stood up and put his hands in his pockets. He went to the window and looked out at the trees. "Why was Roger Clarkson afraid? Was it important?" He looked at Sergeant Foster. "Tomorrow morning , go to Mr Clarkson's office - you have the name" he said | 罗杰站起来离开房间.探长沃尔什站起来把手插进口袋. 他来到窗口看着外面的树."为什么罗杰克拉克森会害怕?有什么重要的?"他看向福斯特探员. "明天早上,到克拉克森先生的办公室,你知道是谁"他说到 |
| "Ask some questions about him, about his job, friends, money." Sergeant Foster wrote it down. "Yes, Inspector." "A good day for tennis, Sergeant?" Sergeant Foster laughed. "Don't say that. It's not easy, you know. I don't like sitting here looking at the sun." | "问他一些问题,关于他的工作,朋友和钱" 探员福斯特记了下来. "是的,探长" "今天是个打网球的好天气啊,探员?" 探员福斯特笑道 "别那么说, 这不容易,你知道的. 我不喜欢坐在这看外面的好天气" |
| Dianne came into the room and sat down. She looked at Sergeant Foster and smiled. "I saw you at the Tennis Club last month, I think. You play very well." Sergeant Foster's face went red. Inspector Walsh looked at him. "Oh yes. A fast and exciting player is Sergeant Foster." | 戴安进到房间坐下. 她看着探员福斯特微笑道 "我上个月在网球俱乐部看到了你,我想,你打的非常好" 探员福斯特的脸红了. 探长沃尔什看着他 "噢是的,福斯特探员是一个速度快又兴奋的球员" |
| Diane smiled again at Sergeant Foster and his face went redder. "Well, Miss Clarkson" Inspector Walsh said "I want you to talk about last night." Diane stopped smiling . "Oh , I can talk about last night. I can't stop talking about it. We were all angry." | 戴安再次对着福斯特探员微笑,他的脸更红了 "好了,克拉克森小姐" 探长沃尔什说到"我想你说说昨晚的事情" 戴安停止i微笑 "噢,我来说说做完的事情,我不得不说,我们大家都很生气" |
| "Mother went to bed early and I made hot milk for her. We were all in the kitchen, and Peter Hobbs came in . He nearly broke the back door down." Dianne stopped. "Yes?" "He was very angry about a letter. He wanted to kill Mother. Are you going to talk to him?" "We're going to talk to everyone" | "妈妈很早旧上床了,我给他做了热牛奶.我们都在厨房,皮特霍伯斯进来了.他几乎把后门砸坏了" 戴安停了 "然后?" "他还是对那封信非常愤怒,他想要杀了妈妈.你们跟他谈了吗?" "我们会跟所有人谈话" |
| "Good. Tom Briggs came into the kitchen, too. Are you going to talk to him?" "I'm asking the questions, Miss Clarkson. When did you take the milk upstairs?" "I went up after Roger." "She stopped for a minute. Then she began again."i didn't like my mother, Inspector. She killed my father, you know." | "好的, 汤姆布吉斯也来到了厨房.你们会找他谈话吗?" "我在问问题,克拉克森女士. 你是什么时候去楼上的" "我在罗杰后面上去" 她停了一会,继续说 "我不喜欢我的妈妈,探长. 她杀了我爸爸,你知道的" |
| "Last winter, after Christmas, she drove the car into a tree and killed my father." Inspector Walsh watched Dianne's face carefully. "I see. So you wanted to kill your mother?" Dianne laughed. "I wanted to kill her, but I didn't. I can tell you a lot of things about this family, Inspector. Everyone wanted Mother to die." | "去年冬天,圣诞节之后. 她开着车撞树杀死了我爸爸." 探长细心的观察着戴安的脸."我明白了,所以你想杀了你妈妈?" 戴安笑了起来. "我是想杀了她,但是我没有. 我能告诉你很多关于这个家庭的事情,探长. 每个人都想妈妈死" |
| "Uncle Albert wanted her money for his wife , Annie. And then my brother. He needs a lot of money. He has an expensive house and an expensive car. And think of Jackie. Do you know that Jackie didn't like Mother?" | "阿尔伯特叔叔想要她的钱给自己妻子,安妮. 还有我兄弟,他需要许多钱,他有很贵的房子和高级车. 想想杰基, 你们知道杰基不喜欢妈妈吗?" |
| "A long time ago, a nice boy worked here. He was the gardener. Jackie loved him very much, but Mother said no. A gardener was not a good husband for a Clarkson girl!" Inspector Walsh listened quietly. All this was very interesting but was it important? Perhaps. What a happy family the Clarksons were! | "很久以前,一个漂亮的男孩在这里工作. 他是个园丁.杰基非常爱他,但是妈妈不允许.一个园丁不配做克拉克森家女儿的丈夫." 探长沃尔什安静的听着. 这些很有意思但是重要吗?也许吧,多么欢乐的克拉克森一家 |
| "We found the empty bottle of sleeping tablets in your room," Inspector Walsh said quietly. He watched her face carefully. Dianne stood up suddenly, her face angry. "What? I didn't put it there! I'm not going to listen to this!" She ran out of the room. "Well, well, well" Inspector Walsh said. | "我们在你的房间发现了装安眠药的空瓶子" 探长沃尔什小声的说. 他注意观察她的脸. 戴安突然站了起来,她的脸上充满了愤怒 "什么?我没有把它放在那里,不想再听这些了!" 她跑出房间. "好吧,好吧,好吧" 探长沃尔什说到 |
| "She likes you, Sergeant. You need to be careful" Sergeant Foster laughed but his face went red again. "Someone put sleeping tablets in Molly's hot milk," the Inspector said. "All the family were in the kitchen last night." | "她喜欢你,警探. 你药小心点" 探员福斯特笑了但是他的脸又红了. "有人再莫莉的热牛奶里放了安眠药" 探长说到 "所有的家人昨晚都在厨房." |
| "Peter Hobbs and Tom Briggs were there, too. One of them killed Molly." Inspector Walsh got his hat and coat. "Come on. We need to talk to Peter Hobbs and Tom Briggs. Let's get some more coffee first. I'd like a sandwich, too. I'm hungry again!" | "皮特霍伯斯 和汤姆布吉斯也在. 他们其中一个杀了莫莉." 探长沃尔什拿起了他的外套和帽子. "走吧,我们需要跟皮特霍伯斯和汤姆布吉斯谈谈. 我们去喝些咖啡先, 我还要来点三明治,我又饿了" |
| They found Petter Hobbs under his car - an old green car. He got up slowly. He wore old blue trousers and a dirty orange shirt. "We want to talk about Mrs Clarkson", Inspector Walsh said "Oh, it's about her," Peter said. He looked at the Inspector. | 特么找到皮特霍伯斯在他的车里,一个绿色的旧车. 他缓慢的起来. 他穿着旧的蓝色裤子和脏的橙色衬衫. "我们想谈谈关于克拉克森女士的事情", 探长沃尔什说 "噢, 关于她" 皮特说. 他看着探长 |
| "I know she's dead. Someone in the village told me." "Why did you go to the Clarksons house last night?" "Jackie wanted me to come and see her brother, Roger" "You're angry" she said. "Come and tell Roger." I went to the house but nobody opened the door. So I made a lot of noise and then they opened the door." | "我知道她死了,镇上的人跟我说的" "为什么你前一晚会在克拉克森的房子里?" "杰基想要我去渐渐她的兄弟,罗杰" "你很生气" 她说 "来跟罗杰谈谈" 我去那房子但是没有人给我开门.于是我弄出很大的声音他们才给我开门了 |
| "Old Mrs Clarkson wasn't there. But I told Roger. I told them all!" Petter hit the car with his hand. "I wanted to kill that woman. I lost my job, myfirst job, because of her. Last month I was in trouble with the police and that old woman wrote to my office and she told them about the police. I wanted to kill her" | "老克拉克森妇人不在那里. 但是我告诉了罗杰,我全都说了!" 皮特用自己的手砸着车. "我药杀了那个女人,我丢了工作,我的第一份工作.就因为她. 上个月我跟警察惹上了一些麻烦,那个老女人写信到我的办公室告诉了他们关于警察的事,我要杀了她" |
| "Take it easy!" Inspector Walsh said. "What happened next?" "Jackie gave me some coffee, but ther brother didn't listen to me" Peter said angrily. "Then Tom Briggs came in . He wanted to talk to Roger, too. But Roger didn't listen to him. Jackie was very unhappy - She nearly cried. Then I went home. That's all." | "放松点!" 探长沃尔什说 "接下来发生了什么?" "杰基给我一些咖啡, 但是他的兄弟不听我的" 皮特生气的说 "接着汤姆布吉斯进来了, 他也想跟罗杰谈话. 但是罗杰不听他的. 杰基非常不高兴\- 她快要哭了. 然后我回家了,就这些" |
| "I see. Now tell me about the tablets. You went to the village on Thursday?" "Tablets? Oh, yes. I remember. Jackie wanted me to get her mother's tablets from the village. I go to the village on my bicycle - this car dosen't work." "Thank you, Peter. That's all." "That's all?" Peter laughed angrily. "You're going to come back, I know that! I know the police!" | "我明白. 现在告诉我关于药的事情. 你星期四去了镇上?" "药? 哦,是的. 我记得. 杰基让我给她妈妈从镇上带药回来. 我骑自行车去镇上的\- 这辆车罢工了" "谢谢你,皮特,就这样吧" "就这样?" 皮特冷笑道 "你们还会回来的,我知道!我了解警察!" |
| Tom Brigg's farm was about half mile away, near the river. It was not a big farm, and the house was old and dirty. "Not much money here," Inspector Walsh said. Tom Briggs was a young man , about thirty years old, with dirty hands and bad teeth. "What's wrong? Excuse me, I'm eating my dinner," he said. "We can wait. Finish your dinner," Inspector Walsh said. "We want to ask one or two questions about last night." "Come and wait in the front room" Tom said and opened the door. | 汤姆布吉斯的农场大概又半英里远,靠近河边. 不是一个很大的农场,房子又旧又脏. "这里不太值钱" 探长沃尔什说. 汤姆布吉斯是一个年轻人,大概30岁的样子,手很脏牙齿也不好. "出了什么事?对不起,我在吃晚饭" 他说 "我们可以等你吃完" 探长沃尔什说 "我们想问你关于昨晚的一到两个问题" "进来吧,在前屋等等" 汤姆说着打开了门 |
| Inspector Walsh looked at the things in the front room. There was an old black and white television, and some books on the table. There was a picture of a happy young girl with long brown hair on the table, too. Inspector Walsh looked at the picture for a long time. Who was the girl? Tom Briggs came back into the front room | 探长沃尔什看着前屋里的东西. 这里有一架老旧的黑白电视机,一些书在桌子上,还有一个快乐年轻棕色长发女孩子的照片.探长沃尔什看着照片很长时间. 这个女孩是谁?汤姆布吉斯回到了前屋 |
| "Finished?" Inspector Walsh asked. "You know Mrs Clarkson is dead?" Tome Briggs sat down suddenly on the nearset chair. "What? How did she die? When did it happen? I was there last night." "She died last night or early this morning." What did you do last night? "Me? Why are you asking me ? I went there to meet Mr Clarkson - Roger. I'm losing money on this farm and I need more land. I want half Mrs Clarkson's garden." | "吃完了?" 探长沃尔什问. "你知道克拉克森夫人死了吗?" 汤姆布吉斯突然坐在了就近的椅子上. "什么? 怎么死的?什么时候发生的事? 我做完在那里" "她在昨完或者今早死的" "你做完在干什么?" "我?为什么问我这个 我去见克拉克森先生 罗杰. 我这个农场亏钱了,我需要更多的土地,我想要克拉克森夫人半个花园" |
| "You went into the kitchen. What did you do next? Can you remember?" Tom Briggs looked at Segeant Foster and then back at Inspector Walsh. "I remember it very well. All the family were in the kitchen. Petter Hobbs was there too. I talked to Roger. He wants his mother to sell the house. But he wants the land. He doesn't want me to have it. But now Mrs Clarkson is dead. What's going to happen now?" Inspector Walsh got up and took the picture of the girl from the table. "Who's this?" | "你去了厨房,记下来干了什么,你记得吗?" 汤姆布吉斯看了看福斯特探员然后看回探长沃尔什."我记得非常清楚.所有的家人都在厨房里.皮特霍布斯也在. 我跟罗杰说话. 她想要母亲卖掉房子,他想要那块地,不想让我得到.但是现在克拉克森夫人死了,接下来会发生什么?" 探长沃尔什起身从桌子上拿起女孩的照片. "这是谁?" |
| Tom's face went red. "Who? Oh! That's a friend. It's not... It was a long time ago." The two detectives walked back to the Clarkson's house through the garden. It was beautiful , green and quiet. Inspector Walsh felt tired and hungry. Who killed Molly? He knew the answer now, but he needed to ask one or two more questions. "Let's go , sergeant, " he said, and put on his hat again. "Tomorrow is a new day." | 汤姆的脸红了起来 "谁?哦!那是 一个朋友,它不是...这事很久以前的事了" 两个侦探走回道了克拉克森房子穿过了花园. 这里真漂亮,绿色又安静. 探长沃尔什感觉到又累又饿. 是谁杀了莫莉? 他现在有了答案, 但是还需要询问一到两个问题. "走吧,警探" 他说着,又带上了帽子. "明天是新的一天" |
| On Monday morning Sergeant Foster went to Roger's office and asked some questions. And then he went to Albert's house and asked some more questions. Inspector Walsh sat in his office and telephoned. He made phone calls about Peter Hobbs and he made phone calls about Tom Briggs. And the he had some coffee and sandwiches. At three o'clock the two detectives drove to the Clarkson's house. | 星期一的早上福斯特探员来到罗杰的办公室询问一些问题. 接着他来到阿尔伯特的房子询问更多问题. 探长沃尔什坐在办公室打电话. 他打给皮特霍伯斯和汤姆布吉斯.然后他吃了了一些三明治和咖啡.三点,两个探员开车来到了克拉克森家. |
| "I would like to see everyon," he told Roger. Everyone came into the sitting room and sat down. Inspector Walsh stood in front of the windows and looked at them, one by one. "I want to talk to you. Someone killed Molly Clarkson. Someone put sleeping tablets in her hot milk and killed her. Nobody wanted to tell me the true story, but now I know the true story and I'm going to tell you." | "我想见所有人" 他告诉罗杰. 所有人来到了会客室坐下. 探长沃尔什站在窗前看着他们,一个接一个. "我想告诉你们,有人杀了莫莉克拉克森. 有人在她的热牛奶里放了安眠药杀了她.没有人告诉我真实的故事,但是我现在知道了实际情况,我会告诉你们" |
| The two dogs came slowly into the room and sat down at Diane's feet. It was very quiet in the room. The Inspector looked at Albert. "Mr King, your wife is very ill and needs a nurse. You told me this. You didn't tell me about your house. You're selling your house next month because you need the money" | 两只狗子慢慢的进道房间坐在戴安的脚边.房间里非常安静.探长看着阿尔伯特 "金先生, 你的妻子病了需要护士,你告诉我了. 但是你没有告诉我关于你的房子,你正在下个月卖你的房子,因为你需要钱" |
| Albert was angry. "Last year I asked Molly's husband for some money, and he said yes. But then he died in an accident." "Accident!" Dianne cried. "That was no accident. Mother killed Daddy because she wanted his money!" "Let's talk about you now, Dianne," said Inspector Wlash. | 阿尔伯特怒了."去年我问莫莉的丈夫要一些钱,他答应了.但是他死于一场意外" "意外!" 戴安哭诉起来 "那不是一场意外,妈妈想要他的钱所以杀了爸爸" "我们马上就谈到你了,戴安" 探长沃尔什说 |
| "You visited your mother every month and you took money from her. Last month she gave you money for your television. This month she gave you money for your telphone. Every month you told your mother:'It was no accident,you killed Dady. I'm going to tell the police' Your mother was afraid of the police and so she gave you the money" | "你每个月都来看你的妈妈并且从她这里要钱.上个月她给你钱买你的电视,这个月她给你钱买电话.每个月你都告诉你妈妈:'那不是意外,你杀了爸爸. 我要去告诉警察' 你的妈妈害怕警察所以每个月都给你钱" |
| "But in the end she wanted to stop you. She told Dr Pratt. No more money ,she told Dr Pratt on Thursday; and on Saturday she died. You took the hot milk to your mother - what did she tell you?" Diane began to cry. "I loved Daddy! He always gave money to me; he loved me. It was Mother - she didn't love Daddy and she didn't love me" | "但是最后她想要制止你.她告诉了普拉特医生,没有更多的钱了,她星期四告诉的普拉特医生;星期六她就死了. 你给你妈妈送的热牛奶\-她给你说了什么?" 戴安开始哭."我爱爸爸!他总是给我钱; 他爱我,只是妈妈\- 她不爱爸爸也不爱我" |
| Dianne stopped. The dogs got up and went to the door. "It's true, I took a lot of money from Mother. On Saturday she told me - no more money. I wanted to kill her, but I didn't." The dogs came back and sat down again at Diane's feet. Inspector Walsh looked at Roger. "Mr Clarkson also needed money." Roger's face went red. "Don't tell them!Please!" | 戴安停了下来. 狗子们站起来来到门口. "是的, 我从妈妈这里拿了许多钱.星期四她告诉我,不再给我钱了. 我想杀了她,但是我没有" 狗子们回到她脚边再次坐了下来. 探长沃尔什看着罗杰 "克拉克森先生也需要钱" 罗杰脸红了 "别告诉他们!求你了!" |
| "Mr Clarkson lost his job last month. He has no money. But he has an expensive house and an expensive car. He likes expensive things." His sisters looked at him, but Roger put his hand over his eyes. "Don't talk to me!" "It doesn't matter now!" Dianne said. "Mother is dead and we have a lot of money. You don't need a job." Roger's face went red again. | "克拉克森先生上个月丢掉了工作. 他没有钱了.但是他又昂贵的房子和车子.他喜欢昂贵的东西" 他的妹妹看着他,但是罗杰用手遮住眼睛 "别跟我说话!" "但是现在没问题了!" 戴安说着 "妈妈现在死了,我们有了许多钱,你不再需要工作." 罗杰的脸又红了起来 |
| "Be quiet, Dianne!" "Now," Inspector Walsh began again. "Peter Hobbs is a very angry young man. Mrs Clarkson was not very nice to him. He got the sleeping tablets from the shop. But did he put the tablets in the hot milk? I think not. Tom Briggs wanted half the garden for his farm. He was in the kitchen that night. Did he put sleeping tablets in the hot milk? I think not." | "闭嘴,戴安!" "现在" 探长沃尔什又开始了 "皮特霍伯斯是一个愤怒的年轻人.克拉克森夫人对他并不友好.是他把安眠药从商店带回来的. 但是他把药放在热牛奶里的吗?我想不是. 汤姆布吉斯想要半个花园给他的农场. 他那晚也在厨房.是他把安眠药放在热牛奶里的吗? 我想不是" |
| Suddenly it began to rain. For a minute everyone watched it through the window. Jackie took a cigarette from her bag and began to smoke. "But someone wanted Peter Hobbs to come into the kitchen that night. She wanted everyone to see him. and listen to him" Inspector Walsh said | 突然下起了雨.一时间大家都向窗外望去.杰基从包里拿出一支烟抽了起来 "但是有人希望皮特霍伯斯那晚来到厨房,她想要每个人都看到他听到他" 探长沃尔什说到 |
| "She...? I don't understand," Roger began, and stopped. Inspector Walsh moved away from the window and sat down. "I'm going to tell you the true story now. Miss Clarkson, you wanted Peter Hobbs to come to the house that night. He was very angry with your mother because of that letter.He said:'I want to kill her' And you wanted everyone to hear that." | "她?...我不明白" 罗杰问了又马上闭嘴. 探长沃尔什离开窗户坐了下来 "我来告诉你们真实的故事. 克拉克森小姐, 你想要皮特霍伯斯那晚进到房间. 他对你母亲的那封信非常生气. 他说过'我要杀死她' 你想所有人都听到" |
| "Why?" Jackie's face went white. "It's not true! What about Diane? You found the empty bottle in her bag!" Dianne stood up. "In my bag? Jackie! What are you talking about?" "Be quiet, please, and sit down," Inspector Walsh said. He looked at Jackie. "It's true:we found the bottle in Diane's bag. But how do you know that? We didn't tell you." "You did...before..you told me before!" | "为什么?" 杰基的脸变得惨白. "这不是真的,那戴安呢?你们从她的包里发现了空的药瓶!" 戴安站起来 "从我的包里? 杰基! 你在说什么?" "安静,请坐下" 探长沃尔什说到. 她看着杰基. "这是事实:我们从戴安的包里找到了药瓶.但是你怎么知道?我们并没有告诉你" "你说了...之前..你之前告诉我的!" |
| "No. We found the empty bottle in Diane's room. We told you that. You talked about Diane's bag; we didn't tell you. Sergeant Foster wrote it all down." Inspector Walsh looked carefuly at Jackie."A long time ago, you knew Tom Briggs. He was the gardener here and you loved him. But your mother didn't like him." Jackie put her hands to her head. | "不. 我们在戴安的房间里发现了空药瓶. 我们这么告诉你的.但是你提到了戴安的包;我们并没有告诉你. 探员福斯特都完整的记录着" 探长沃尔什仔细的盯着杰基 "很久以前,你就认识汤姆布吉斯. 他是这里的园丁而且你爱上了他. 但是你的妈妈不喜欢他" 杰基用手撑着自己的头 |
| "No! No!" "We found your picture -an old one - in Mr Briggs's house. You were younger then, and your hair was long. Last year Tom briggs came back, and you wanted him. He loved you, too, but he had no money. He wanted the garden for his farm, he wanted money, he wanted you. But your mother said no. In the end, you wanted to kill your mother and you did kill her." | "不!不!" "我们发现了你的照片-很老的一张-在布吉斯先生的房子里. 那时候你更年轻,你还是i长头发.去年汤姆布吉斯回来了,你想要他,他也爱过你.但是他没有钱. 他为了自己的农场想要这花园,他想要钱,他想要你.但是你的妈妈不同意.到最后,你想要杀死你妈妈并且你也确实杀了她" |
| "Your mother went downstairs to see the dogs and you put the sleeping tablets in her hot milk. Later, you put the empty bottle in Dianne's bag." Jackie stood up. Her eyes were dark and afraid. "You don't understand!" she cried. "Mother gave me nothing...all those years. I want'ed to be happy...to be with Tom. That's all . I love Tom, and he loves me. But Mother said no. Always no. " Then she began to cry. Nobody looked at her. | "你的妈妈想要下楼照顾狗子,而你趁机把安眠药放在她的热牛奶里.然后,你把空药瓶放进了戴安的包" 杰基站起来.她的眼睛空洞又恐惧. "你们不明白" 她哭着说"妈妈什么都不给我...过去的这些年. 我想要快乐..跟汤姆一起.这就是全部了. 我爱汤姆他也爱着我. 但是妈妈不同意,总是不同意" 然后她开始哭,没有人看她 |
| Jackie left the house in a police car. Inspector Walsh watched and then walked slowly to his car. He felt tired and hungry. He stoped and looked back at the house. "Well" he said to Sergeant Foster, "in the end, they got the money:Albert , Roger, Diane. They're all rich now. But are they going to be happy?" he got into the car. "Let's go ," he said. "I'm hungry; I need a sandwich." | 杰基被警车带离房子. 探长沃尔什看着慢慢的走上自己的车.他感到又累又饿.他停下来回头看着房子. "好吧"他给探员福斯特说,"到最后,他们得到了钱:阿尔伯特,罗杰,戴安.他们都有钱了现在,但是他们真的会变得快乐吗?" 他上了车 "走吧" 他说到 "我饿了,我需要个三明治." |
